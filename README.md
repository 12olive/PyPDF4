# PyPDF4

PyPDF4 is a pure-python PDF library capable of
splitting, merging together, cropping, and transforming
the pages of PDF files. It can also add custom
data, viewing options, and passwords to PDF files.
It can retrieve text and metadata from PDFs as well
as merge entire files together.

What happened to PyPDF2?  Nothing; it's still available
at https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2 .  For various reasons
claird will eventually explain, I've simply decided to mark
a new "business model" with a slightly-renamed project name.
PyPDF4 will continue to be available at no charge, but,
starting in August 2018, I have strong plans for better 
ongoing support.
