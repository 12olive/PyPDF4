# PyPDF4 Sample Code Folder
This will contain demonstrations of the many features PyPDF4 is capable of.
Example code should make it easy for users to know how to use all aspects of
PyPDF4.

## How to run
We recommend running each script by using the `python -m` flag or by setting
the `PYTHONPATH` context variable of your shell:

* `python -m samplecode.make_simple` (no trailing `.py` -- we are referencing
  python packages)
* `$ export PYTHONPATH="."; python ./samplecode/make_simple.py`

`python` can be either `python2` or `python3`.

## Contributing to `samplecode`
Feel free to add any type of PDF file or sample code, either by:

	1. Sending it via email to PyPDF4@phaseit.net
	2. Including it in a pull request on GitHub
